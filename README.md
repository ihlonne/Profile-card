## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I mostly used this project for practice but had the opportunity to learn how to use display: inline-block.

### Continued development

I am still a shaky when it comes to flexbox and I have yet to use grid for a personal project. I will be looking into both in the future.
